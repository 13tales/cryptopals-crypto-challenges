# About

 The [Cryptopals challenges](https://www.cryptopals.com) in Clojure. They are a series of exercises designed to demostrate how to break cryptography in the real-world. They were originally created by Matasano, and are now hosted by the NCC Group. Thanks to both for sharing these, they're a blast!

## Notes
The code is a bit more ad-hoc than I normally write, since each challenge is somewhat independent. What's actually common ends up placed in the util/cipher/core/rng.clj files. The challenge sets themselves are in the set* files.

If you're looking at the various sets and wondering why there's Vanilla Ice lyrics, rest assured, I'm not a fan. That's just what many of the challenges decrypt to!

## Usage

You can look at my code if you get stuck, but really the fun is all in solving it for yourself. I have some none-spoiler notes [here](http://modulolotus.net/posts/2017-05-17-thoughts-on-cryptopals-1/) that may help, too.
